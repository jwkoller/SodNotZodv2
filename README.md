# SodNotZodv2
A significantly updated and expanded version of a basic retail purchasing program. This program was created from scratch rather than updated from the previous SodNotZod.  New functionality added as I progressed through OOP programming courses include using mulitple classes, passing objects to modify attributes, single and multi-dimensional arrays, reading and writing to files, sequential and binary searches, and using bubble sorting. The porgram also includes a User Profile class I created that allows a user to create a user name and password and then login to the program.  While it has absolutely zero actual security to it, it was good practice in using arrays and sequential searches.  Currently still using one char variable in Main method to hold a menu selection, and a Main class constant 2D array for menus as I have not progressed to the point of creating visual menus with action items.
