# SodNotZodv2
A significantly updated and expanded version of a basic retail purchasing program. This program was created from scratch rather than updated from the previous SodNotZod.  New functionality added as I progressed through OOP programming courses include using mulitple classes, passing objects to modify attributes, using a random number generator, single and multi-dimensional arrays, reading and writing to files, sequential and binary searches, and using bubble sorting. The program also includes a User Profile class I created that allows a user to create a user name and password and then login to the program.  While it has absolutely zero actual security to it, it was good practice in using arrays and sequential searches.  Currently still using one char variable in Main method to hold a menu selection, and a Main class constant 2D array for menus as I have not progressed to the point of creating visual menus.

An inventory list file is provided ("inventoryfile.dat") that needs to be loaded within the program at prompt. It's a simple text file so feel free to add additional records to it should you want. Has four fields (ID#, Name, Price, Qty-in-inventory) with tab deliminators.

The workspace file path the program is in needs to be added to a class constant in the OrderWriter class if you don't want to have to manually delete the file after each run-through of the program.
